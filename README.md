## Data Collection
In the `data_collection` folder, `Bitcoin_Ledger_Reader_V3.1.py` is used for collecting Bitcoin ledger data from [BTC.com](https://btc.com/), also we share **partial Bitcoin ledger data** in JSON format from height 600,000 to 605,999 on our [Kaggle BABD-13](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/babd13) since the whole raw Bitcoin ledger data are too large. We also recommend using [BlockSci](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci) for raw Bitcoin ledger collection, the collected JSON format may be somewhat different from the format in this work but can be modified.

`labeled_data_API.py` is used for collecting Bitcoin addresses with labels from [WalletExplorer](https://www.walletexplorer.com/) that is completed by Qingqing Yang ([@Vinedou](https://github.com/Vinedou)). The collected labeled Bitcoin addresses are saved in .csv files (we named them `Bitcoin_Ads_type.csv` files for easier understanding) as shown in `data_collection` folder. The `Bitcoin_Ads_type.csv` files, including only Bitcoin addresses and their labels, are loaded in all *processing indicators* cells in `data_extraction.ipynb`.

Notably, we would like to thank [Ale≈° Janda](http://www.alesjanda.cz/) for his generous help in providing API.
 
## Graph Generation
To generate a Bitcoin transaction graph as we designed (shown in Fig. 1 in [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2023.3347894)) from Bitcoin ledger data in JSON format, we select several important attributes to construct the Bitcoin transaction graph which can be found in `graph_generation.py` implemented by [graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/). 

In this step, we input continuous Bitcoin ledger data in JSON format (see JSON examples in [Kaggle BABD-13](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/babd13)) to generate the Bitcoin transaction graph consisting of two files `revmap.pkl` and `BitcoinGraph.gt`. These two files are loaded in the first cell of `data_extraction.ipynb` as the preparation before calculating the features of Bitcoin addresses with labels. 

## Feature Extraction
In this process, we extract the required features from the generated Bitcoin transaction graph for the concrete labeled Bitcoin addresses. There are two kinds of features we are concerned about in this work that are **statistical features** and **local structural features**. The methods to extract statistical and structural features can be found in `moduleG.py`. The primary difference between calculating these two types of features is that we generate a subgraph before extracting local structural features. To accelerate the speed of feature extraction, we apply the parallel computing approach here.

Next, we run the code in `data_extraction.ipynb` to extract features. First, we load the generated Bitcoin transaction graph (i.e., `revmap.pkl` and `BitcoinGraph.gt`) through the *read the graph* cell. After loading the whole graph, we input `Bitcoin_Ads_type.csv` files with only Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding labels (each type of Bitcoin address is stored in a different .csv file, we process each .csv file separately and generate the corresponding .csv file including all features) to further compute the statistical and local structural features in different *processing indicators* cells in `data_extraction.ipynb` (we recommend using cells noted *parallel computing* to calculate features for faster processing). 

## Data Preprocess
The results of the feature extraction module are stored in different .csv files based on different address types. For further analyzing the data, it is necessary to preprocess the current data by `functions_csv_preprocess.py` in the `preprocess_csv` folder. First, we separately preprocess each .csv file with different types of BItcoin addresses via steps 1 to 6. After that, we use step 7 to add number labels to different Bitcoin addresses to represent different types. Finally, in step 8, we merge all preprocessed .csv files to generate `BABD-13.csv` as shown in [our Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/babd13).

## Data Analysis
We use the tools and models provided by [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [xgboost](https://xgboost.ai/) to analyze and study our data, the code can be seen in `feature_selection.py` and `machine_learning.py` in `data_analysis` folder. The specific analysis of our dataset can be found in [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2023.3347894). 

Additionally, we also propose a method to divide the testing set and training set while considering the even assignment of strong label address and weak label address in `split_train_test.py` that is completed by Tiantian Li ([@oopshell](https://github.com/oopshell)).

## Additional Notes
In the `format` folder, `csv_format.yml` is the header of raw feature data .csv files, and `original_ledger_format.json` is an example of the Bitcoin ledger we use. In addition, `networkx_test_version.py` in the `networkx_test` folder is the testing code of our designed methods implemented by [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) that can only be utilized for tests on small graphs.
